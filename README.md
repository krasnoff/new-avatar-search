# Kobi's Exercise

This project is a front-end project created with angular 2.

You can see the project live in: http://kobi-avatar-search.surge.sh/

Because it is a front end project I saved the bookmarks on the client's Localstorage object.

You can review all the saved bookmarks by pressing the "get bookmark" button.

## AvatarSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
